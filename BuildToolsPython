Make File : To automate common tasks. Use named taskt to run long commands. 


Poetry : To manage dependencies ( similar to pip). Manage virtual env(venv). Build and publish python package.

.PHONY is a special declaration in a Makefile that says: “This is not a file. It's just a named task I always want to run.”


Example
-----------
install is a named task

.PHONY: install run build test clean

install:
	poetry install
