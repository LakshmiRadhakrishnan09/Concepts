Make File : To automate common tasks. Use named taskt to run long commands. 


Poetry : To manage dependencies ( similar to pip). Manage virtual env(venv). Build and publish python package.

.PHONY is a special declaration in a Makefile that says: “This is not a file. It's just a named task I always want to run.”


Example
-----------
install is a named task

.PHONY: install run build test clean

install:
	poetry install


POETRY

.toml file : You declare what dependency is required
.lock file : created by Poetry

poetry install : reads from .lock file and installs that.
poetry update : updates the lock file with newer versions.

If you remove a package from pyproject.toml, you must run poetry lock or poetry install to update the lock file accordingly.
Always commit both pyproject.toml and poetry.lock to version control

Always commit poetry.lock to version control — especially for apps — so that everyone installs the same versions.

If you're writing a library, you might exclude poetry.lock and let consumers resolve their own versions.
